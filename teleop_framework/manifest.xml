  <!-- Package summary -->
  <description brief="Generic tele-operation framework." >

    This package provides header files and a library which implement a
    framework for managing generic tele-operation source (e.g. keyboard,
    joystick, etc.) and sink (e.g. mobile robot base, pan-tilt unit, etc.)
    devices.

    Structures are provided which describe the state of tele-operation source
    devices.  Using these structures, a simple interface class is provided
    which defines low-level interactions with source devices.  Each type of
    tele-operation source device must implement this interface in order to
    be accessible to the framework.  This interface can also be used to
    interact with tele-operation source devices.  An adapter class is also
    provided which allows high-level interaction with tele-operation source
    devices.
